#Welcome to Where My Dogs At?

## Description
This is an app that simplifies the lives of dog owners, especially households where multiple people care for the dog. The site gives users a centralized location where owners can check off caretaking actions, such as 'Fed breakfast?' for each dog in their list. Users can also add additional owners, for each dog they own, so that all concerned parties will see the latest updates for the dog.
